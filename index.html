            I know today you are busy because of your friend. So I thought lets write down one incident that happened yesterday with. I'm writing here because may be tommorrow I will forget this incident.
            So I always went to a shop to buy milk from last two weeks. Yesterday, the shopkeer asked me that do I study. So I said no and I'm doing a job and he was shocked and said that I don't look like that I'm doing a job.
            This was because I have a childish look, voice and my hieght is too small.ðŸ˜‰
