            I know today you are busy because of your friend. So I thought lets write down one incident that happened yesterday with. I'm writing here because may be tommorrow I will forget this incident.
            So I always went to a shop to buy milk from last two weeks. Yesterday, the shopkeer asked me that do I study. So I said no and I'm doing a job and he was shocked and said that I don't look like that I'm doing a job.
            This was because I have a childish look, voice and my hieght is too small.üòâ

            There are many more that I want to share with you. Just waiting for the time when you will get free and we will have an awesome call.
            I don't know but from last month one amazing thing is happening with me, that my morning starts with your good morning text and night end with your good night text.
            And this is very amazing for me and I feel so blessed that I found you as my friend. Here I'm not saying best friend because for that there is still needed some more time to understand each other. But I have learned lots of things from you.
            And I'm hoping that I'll learn more things from you.
