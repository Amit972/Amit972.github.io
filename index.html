            I know today you are busy because of your friend. So I thought let's write down one incident that happened yesterday with me. I'm writing here because maybe tomorrow I will forget this incident.
            I'm going to a shop to buy milk for the last two weeks. Yesterday, the shopkeeper asked me do I study. So I said no and I'm doing a job and he was shocked and said that I don't look like that I'm doing a job.
            This was because I have a childish look, voice and my height is too small.ðŸ˜‰
